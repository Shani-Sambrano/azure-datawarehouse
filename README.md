# Azure Data Warehouse – Elevate AI Solutions

Azure Synapse & Data Lake project for **Elevate AI Solutions** – Data Engineering and AI Analytics.

This repository contains the **Azure Synapse & Data Lake implementation** for Elevate AI Solutions.  
It serves as a learning and production-ready environment for **data engineering, analytics, and AI orchestration** projects.

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

- **Azure Data Lake (ADLS Gen2)** – raw, silver, and gold zones for staged data refinement  
- **Azure Synapse Analytics (Serverless SQL Pool)** – query and transformation layer  
- **Azure Data Factory / Synapse Pipelines** – ETL orchestration  
- **Power BI / QuickSight** – visualization and reporting  
- **GitHub Integration** – version control for SQL scripts, pipelines, and notebooks

## 📁 Data Lake Zones

data/
├─ raw/ # landing zone for unprocessed source data
├─ silver/ # cleaned & standardized datasets
└─ gold/ # business-ready, aggregated data models


| Zone | Purpose | Typical Files | Example Actions |
|------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| **raw** | Exact copies from source systems (no transforms) | CSV, JSON, Parquet | Ingest data, add source/date partitions |
| **silver** | Cleaned, typed, de-duplicated | Parquet | Null handling, schema enforcement, joins |
| **gold** | Curated for analytics/ML | Parquet, views | Aggregations, star schemas, features |

## 🧩 Synapse Workspace Structure

notebooks/ # Spark notebooks for data exploration and ML prep
sql/ # T-SQL scripts for transformations and views
pipelines/ # ETL pipelines for ingestion and orchestration
linkedServices/ # Data source connection definitions
datasets/ # Schema-linked datasets used across pipelines
triggers/ # Time-based or event-based pipeline triggers
externalTables/ # Mapped tables pointing to external storage
views/ # Curated analytical views or semantic models


Each folder aligns with Azure Synapse’s Git-connected structure, allowing version control for all data factory and analytics artifacts.

## 🔗 Synapse Mapping (planned)

- External data source → **ADLS Gen2** (this repo mirrors folder structure)  
- Ingest to `raw/` with Copy activity or Spark Notebook  
- Transform to `silver/` using Serverless SQL or Data Flows  
- Publish to `gold/` as Parquet, views, or Power BI dataset endpoints  

---

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Practice **DP-203 Azure Data Engineer Associate** lab structure  
- Build reusable **Synapse & Data Lake** templates  
- Showcase data pipeline automation and model-driven analytics
